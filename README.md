# ZerotoSnowpark_TastyBytes
A Hands-on-Lab demonstrating end-to-end ML in Snowflake. 

Tasty Bytes is one of the largest food truck networks in the world with localized menu options spread across 30 major cities in 15 countries. Tasty Bytes is aiming to achieve 25% YoY sales growth over 5 years.

As Tasty Bytes Data Scientists, we have been asked to support this goal by helping our food truck drivers more intelligently pick where to park for shifts. We want to direct our trucks to locations that are expected to have the highest sales on a given shift. This will maximize our daily revenue across our fleet of trucks.

To provide this insight, we will use historical shift sales at each location to build a model. This data has been made available to us in Snowflake. Our model will provide the predicted sales at each location for the upcoming shift.

This is an introduction to Snowpark for Snowflake. We will use Snowpark to:
Explore the data
Perform feature engineering
Train a model
Deploy the model in Snowflake
Why Snowpark?

No copies or movement of data
Maintain governance
Leverage Snowflake scalable compute
...and more!
